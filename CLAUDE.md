# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RailScraper is a Python web scraper that fetches Estonian rail (Elron) timetables for five route pairs (Laagri↔Tallinn, Kivimäe↔Tallinn, Rahumäe↔Tallinn, Nõmme↔Tallinn, Lilleküla↔Nõmme) and generates a static HTML timetable page. It runs daily via GitHub Actions (cron at 22:00 UTC, i.e. 01:00 Tallinn after midnight) and commits the updated `timetable.html` and `timetable_data.json` back to the repo.

## Commands

```bash
# Run the scraper (requires Chrome installed)
python RailScraper.py

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There are no tests, linter, or build steps configured.

## Architecture

The entire application is a single file: `RailScraper.py`.

- **`RailScraper` class** — uses Selenium (headless Chrome) to load the Elron ticket site, waits for JS-rendered content, then parses trip times with BeautifulSoup. Routes are configured via a `config.json` (auto-created with defaults if missing).
- **`generate_html()`** — produces a self-contained HTML page with inline CSS/JS inside a Python f-string. Literal CSS/JS braces are doubled (`{{` `}}`); single braces are f-string interpolation. The client-side JS handles real-time countdown timers, past-train filtering, status indicators, horizontal tab-bar scroll with edge-fade, and persistence (one key: `railscraper_last_pair`; see memory `project_persistence_model.md`). The route tab bar uses two nested elements — `.tab-bar-wrap` is `position: sticky` (chrome), and `.tab-bar` inside it is the horizontal scroll container; sticky + overflow can't co-exist on one element.
- **`main()`** — single-run entrypoint optimized for GitHub Actions (no scheduling loop).

## Key Files

- `RailScraper.py` — scraper + HTML generator
- `timetable.html` — generated output (committed by CI)
- `timetable_data.json` — JSON backup of scraped data (committed by CI)
- `.github/workflows/scrape.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow (daily cron + manual dispatch)
- `config.json` — route configuration (auto-generated on first run, not committed)

## Scraping Details

- Target site: `elron.pilet.ee` — URLs are date-templated (`{date}` replaced with `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- CSS selector for trips: `.trip-summary__timespan`
- Times are extracted via regex from `<span>` elements within each trip container
- A 5-second sleep + 10-second WebDriverWait is used for JS content to render
